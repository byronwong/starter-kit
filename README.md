This is a basic starter-kit that runs a simple express server. Ideally for sandbox and very early prototypes.

## Good to know
To package this project (deleting node_modules) you can use `npm run package`
- requires `del-cli` to be installed: `npm install --global del-cli`

## Getting started
- `npm i`
- `npm start` - NOTE: we are using `nodemon` to reset the serve on change.
- `npm-run-all --parallel task1 task2` - runs tasks in parallel
- `-s ` - run in silent mode
