This is a basic starter-kit that runs a simple express server. Ideally for sandbox and very early prototypes.

## Getting started
- `npm i`
- `npm start` - NOTE: we are using `nodemon` to reset the serve on change.
- `npm-run-all --parallel task1 task2` - runs tasks in parallel
- `-s ` - run in silent mode

## Things to do
- remove nodemon and webpack hot loader and opn modules now refresh page
- setup sass compiling
